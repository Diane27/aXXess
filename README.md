# aXXess

*This project is our submission to the "Hacking for Humanity SF 2017" hackathon. We won the "Girls in Tech's Favorite Award"!*

**aXXess** is an app for on-demand delivery of menstrual supplies targeted to homeless women. The app is designed to be accessible through the Internet and text message. The app also provides direction for the delivery drivers to get to the women in need.
